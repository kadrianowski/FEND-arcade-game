# Arcade Game Project | Udacity FEND Nanodegree | 2018
Project 4 for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree course

## What's this game about?

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Mighty Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
